This project to practice how FragmentContainerView is used.
MainActivity has FragmentContainerView which populates 2 fragments ActiveFragment and InactiveFragment.
OnClick of button inactive fragment shows, active fragment is already instantiated.
Both ActiveFragment and InactiveFragment got same recyclerview rv_list_item.

TabActivity2 is a custom tab activity using FragmentContainerView.
onClick of tabs fragments are switched.
It doesn't save the state of the recyclerview. scroll state.

TabActivity3 is ready made tab activity which uses viewPager & viewmodel.
It saves the state of the recyclerview. scroll state.
